# Pathfinding Algorithms

## Goals
Implement each of the pathfinding algorithms, which are:
- [Depth-first Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Breadth-first Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [Best-first Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search)
- [A&ast; Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

Then, demonstrate the performance of each algorithm.

## Languages/Libraries

### JavaScript
JavaScript is used to implement the pathfinding algorithms.

### HTML
HTML is used to display the resulting program on the web browser.

### p5.js
[p5.js](https://p5js.org) is used to ease the process of programming the graphical display of this program.
